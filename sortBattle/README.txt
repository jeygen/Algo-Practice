To compare insertionSort(), mergeSort():
	1. Compile with make 
	2a. Run runSorts35.sh or runSorts1000.sh scripts and the randomly generated numbers from the text files will be input into each sorting function.
	Or
	2b. Run insertionSort.c or mergeSort.c individually and input your own values to be sorted.
    Or
	2c. Run runInsertSorts.sh to compare insertSort() against itself with 5000 ascending, descending and random values.
	Or
	2d. Run runMergeSorts.sh to compare mergeSort() against itself with 5000 ascending, descending and random values.

To Do:

	- After next lecture? Or after you look into how to analyze. 
	- Perform analysis on both functions
	- Answer questions below

# Questions and Answers

1. A brief summary of what you accomplished and what (if any) parts you did not
complete or bugs that you are aware of but have not fixed.

	- describe genNum, and scripts
	- describe insertion sorte
	- describe merge sort
	- describe using metrics
	- mention lack of swaps

2. Analysis (including equations for number of moves, swaps and compares as a function of n) for the best-, 
average- and worst-case behaviors of InsertionSort and MergeSort.

	InsertionSort()
