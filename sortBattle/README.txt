To compare insertionSort(), mergeSort() run the runSort35.sh or runSort1000.sh
and the randomly generated numbers from the text files will be input into each sorting function.

Questions:
	- myCompare() in for loops?
	- no mySwaps in insertion?
	- how mySwap() is being used in insertion is appropriate?
	- myCopy() for primitives and i++?

Bugs:
	- insertion isnt sorting the last number
