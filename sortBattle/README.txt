To compare insertionSort(), mergeSort() run the runSort35.sh or runSort1000.sh scripts
and the randomly generated numbers from the text files will be input into each sorting function.

Questions:
	- myCompare() in for loops?
	- no mySwaps in insertion?
	- how mySwap() is being used in insertion is appropriate?
	- myCopy() for primitives and i++?

Bugs:
	- insertion isnt sorting the last number


1. A brief summary of what you accomplished and what (if any) parts you did not
complete or bugs that you are aware of but have not fixed.

2. Analysis (including equations for number of moves, swaps and compares as a function of n) for the best-, 
average- and worst-case behaviors of InsertionSort and MergeSort.
