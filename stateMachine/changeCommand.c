/*
The change command is invoked by the letter `c' followed by a `1' or a `0' followed by the name of a state 
(i.e. a single letter in the range Aâ€“H). This command modifies the state machine such that the `0' (or `1')
command applied to the current state will cause the machine to change to the named state and that this change 
is the state machine configuration will continue. This command should produce no output.
